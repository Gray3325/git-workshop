this is my homework   
### 上課心得
>覺得老師上課的內容和速度都可以跟到，不會覺得太快或太慢，可以的話想多聽一些關於如何增加團隊有效溝通的技巧，還想知道如果要應徵國外的工作的話需要俱備怎樣的實力，因為想要遠距工作，感覺就很需要良好的溝通技巧。

##### 以下可以隨便看看

*Actually I don't know what to write* .  
__Just write about my dental implant today.__    
_I was a little **nervous** about going to the dentist_   
## Here are the lyrics from "**the call**"
* It started out as a feeling
* Which then grew into a hope
* Which then turned into a quiet thought
* Which then turned into a quiet word   

1.And then that word grew louder and louder         
2.Til it was a battle cry       
3.I'll come back   
4.When you call me  
5.No need to say goodbye   

## Waving Through A Window

1. I've learned to slam on the brake
1. Before I even turn the key   
    1. Before I make the mistake
    1. Before I lead with the worst of me

## something I like   
>Education teaches us how to make decisions, but we rarely have the opportunity to carefully sort out and think about it. Before yes or no, there will be many positive and negative thoughts in it, and finally the two parties are persuaded to become the answer.      
>>Don't hate yourself in this state. Whether it’s not straightforward enough, whether you want to escape, or can’t face it. It’s okay to be confused about what to do and what to do. It's normal to go back and forth.

## Table

| to the | **best person** |
| -------------|:---|
|left  |  right| RRR |
|Accepting | who you are now |
|is far more difficult than | than becoming an illusory "better person".|
| People who deny themselves | are lonely no matter where they are. |

Although loneliness is not a bad thing.
But there is no way to identify with yourself, it will be really very lonely.

## Code

```js
let a = 1 ;
funtion sss(b) {
    b = 1 + a ;
}
console.log(sss(2));
```

## Code2

the answer is ` 3 `.

# The End .
