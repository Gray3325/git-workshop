## hi 
### and I do right
#### or
##### not?
###### so
this is my homework   
*Actually I don't know what to write* .  
__Just write about my dental implant today.__    
_I was a little **nervous** about going to the dentist_   
## Here are the lyrics from "**the call**"
* It started out as a feeling
* Which then grew into a hope
* Which then turned into a quiet thought
* Which then turned into a quiet word   

1.And then that word grew louder and louder         
2.Til it was a battle cry       
3.I'll come back   
4.When you call me
5.No need to say goodbye
